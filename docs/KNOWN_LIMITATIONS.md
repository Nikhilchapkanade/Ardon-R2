# Known Limitations

This document is the authoritative list of features that are **intentionally
incomplete** in the current release. Each entry records the algorithm in
use, why it falls short of a "production" implementation, and what would
need to change to close the gap. The goal is to never let users be
silently misled by a function that looks correct but isn't.

## Platform support

### Apple Silicon (aarch64-apple-darwin) — JIT falls back to interpreter

**Status:** Ardon-R2 is **fully supported** on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)
and ARM Linux. The interpreter, kernel layer, columnar storage,
parallel dispatch, and every statistical function work natively and
return outputs bit-identical to x86_64. The Cranelift JIT path is
gated: on aarch64 it returns `None` from `try_compile_closure` and
the engine cleanly executes the same code through the interpreter.

**Why the gate exists:** Cranelift 0.105.4 (the JIT backend Ardon-R2
uses) implements the Procedure Linkage Table only for x86_64. On
aarch64, calling `JITModule::new()` panics during PLT construction —
an upstream limitation. Phase R.M (v0.1.1) added a compile-time
`JIT_SUPPORTED` constant in `r2-jit` and an early-return guard so
the engine never reaches the panicking code path on aarch64.

**What this means for users:**

- Apple Silicon Macs build, install, and run the full Ardon-R2
  language without any workaround needed. Rosetta 2 is not required.
- Compute-bound workloads that would benefit from the JIT (fused
  `sum(sqrt(x*x+1))`, repeated `sapply`, Monte Carlo inner loops) run
  through the interpreter on aarch64. Wall-clock performance is
  slower than on x86_64 for those workloads. All other paths (kernel
  layer, parallel dispatch, columnar storage, linalg) run at full
  native speed.
- Statistical correctness is identical across architectures —
  same `lm`, `glm`, `t.test`, `summary` outputs to the last bit.

**Path to full JIT on aarch64:** Upgrade `cranelift-jit` from 0.105 to
a version that implements aarch64 PLT (currently a v0.2.0 target).
Estimated 200–500 LoC of Cranelift API churn to absorb.

CI tests `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, and `macos-latest` (Apple
Silicon) on every push.

## Linear algebra (`r2-linalg`, `r2-base::linalg_ops`)

### `svd(M)` — full thin SVD now shipped ✅ (Tier 1)

**Status:** `svd(M)` returns `$d`, `$u`, and `$v` — thin SVD `M = U·diag(d)·Vᵀ`
where U is m×n with orthonormal columns and V is n×n with orthonormal
columns (R convention: `$v` holds V itself, not Vᵀ).

**Implementation:** New `r2_linalg::dgesvd_full(m, n, A) → (σ, U, Vᵀ)`.
Householder bidiagonalization with reverse-application of stored
reflectors onto thin identities (`dorgbr`-style) builds U₁ and V₁;
diagonalization of B goes through Bᵀ·B (n×n symmetric tridiagonal) using
the already-shipped `dsyev_full`, producing σ²/V₂; U₂ recovered via
B·V₂·diag(1/σ). Final factors U = U₁·U₂, V = V₁·V₂. Tests verify
reconstruction `A ≈ U·diag(σ)·Vᵀ` to ~1e-9 and orthonormality
`UᵀU ≈ I_n`, `VᵀV ≈ I_n` on 3×2 / 4×3 cases plus diagonal known-σ.

**Honest accuracy caveat:** the Bᵀ·B route squares the condition number
of A. For matrices with condition number κ(A) ≲ 1/√ε ≈ 6.7×10⁷ — which
covers the overwhelming majority of practical statistics/ML workloads —
singular values and vectors are accurate to ~1e-12. For badly
conditioned matrices (κ(A) approaching 1/ε ≈ 4.5×10¹⁵), small singular
values lose accuracy proportional to κ², equivalent to roughly half the
floating-point precision on the small end of the spectrum. Large
singular values remain accurate. The reconstruction `A ≈ U·diag(σ)·Vᵀ`
remains norm-wise tight regardless of conditioning.

**Closure path to κ-independent accuracy:** replace phase 2 with proper
LAPACK `dbdsqr` — implicit-shift bidiagonal QR with Givens rotations
accumulated directly into U₂ and V₂. ~300 LoC of dense numerical code,
delicate convergence and deflation logic. Deferred — current accuracy
is sufficient for all practical statistics workloads and the
reconstruction property holds. The values-only `dgesvd` is retained
unchanged for callers that don't need vectors.

### `eigen(A)` — eigenvectors now shipped ✅ (Tier 1)

**Shipped this round:** new `dsyev_full(n, A) → (eigenvalues, eigenvectors)`
in `r2-linalg::decomp`. Classical three-stage pipeline:
1. Householder tridiagonalization (A → T = QᵀAQ, accumulating Q)
2. Implicit symmetric QR with Wilkinson shift on the tridiagonal
3. Back-transform: eigenvectors of A = Q · eigenvectors of T

Tests verify `Q · diag(λ) · Qᵀ ≈ A` and orthonormality `QᵀQ ≈ I` for
diagonal, 2×2 closed-form, 3×3 mixed, and a 3×3 with adjacent
near-equal eigenvalues.

`bi_eigen` now returns both `$values` and `$vectors`.
`bi_prcomp` now returns `$rotation` (eigenvectors of the covariance
matrix). The standalone Jacobi `dsyev` (values-only) is retained for
callers that don't need vectors.

### Previous limitation entry (now historical):
*`eigen(A)` previously used Jacobi rotation, eigenvalues only.*

**Status:** Returns `$values` for any symmetric matrix. Eigenvectors are
not returned.

**Why:** `r2_linalg::dsyev` uses the Jacobi rotation method
(textbook, repeatedly zero the largest off-diagonal entry). Numerically
stable and always converges, but O(n³) with a large constant — slow for
n ≳ 100. Eigenvector accumulation through Jacobi sweeps is implemented
but currently not wired through the `eigen()` builtin's return list.

**Closure path:** Same upgrade as `svd` — switch to tridiag + symmetric
QR. Adds eigenvector return as a side effect of the Givens accumulation.

### `prcomp(X)` — covariance + Jacobi route

**Status:** Correct results. Slow for wide data (n_features ≳ 100).

**Why:** Routes through `cov(X) = XᵀX/(n-1)` followed by Jacobi
eigendecomposition. The textbook concern with this route is precision
loss vs. SVD-on-X (the squared singular values lose half their digits in
fp64). For the column counts typical of statistical work this is well
within tolerance, but the SVD-on-X route is the more numerically robust
choice for ill-conditioned matrices.

**Closure path:** Once SVD is fixed (above), `prcomp` will switch to
SVD-on-X internally. Fields `$sdev`, `$rotation`, `$center`, `$scale`
will be derived directly from the SVD factors with full eigenvector
support.

### Divide-and-conquer SVD/eigensolver

**Status:** Not implemented; not on the v0.x roadmap.

**Why not yet:** D&C (Cuppen 1981) for symmetric tridiagonal matrices
requires a secular-equation solver (≈500 LOC for the inner Newton
iteration with rational interpolation safeguards), deflation logic for
clustered eigenvalues and tiny rank-1 components, and recursive
eigenvector accumulation with Householder back-transform. A correct,
hardened implementation is on the order of 1000–1500 LOC and benefits
from an extensive numerical regression corpus (clustered spectra,
near-zero z-vectors, exact-equal diagonals). LAPACK's `dstedc` took the
community years to settle.

**Closure path:** D&C is an **optimization**, not a correctness fix. The
right time to add it is after `dsteqr`-style QR is in place and
benchmarks show QR is the bottleneck for a real workload (typically
n ≳ 500). When that triggers, D&C lands as its own phase with: a design
doc, an oracle test corpus, QR as the regression baseline, and a
feature-flag rollout (D&C selectable per-call until confidence accrues).

## Strings (`r2-strings`)

### Pattern functions: `grep`, `grepl`, `gsub`, `sub`, `regexpr` ✅ regex shipped

**Status:** With `--features regex` (default ON) these functions use a
real regex engine (`regex-lite`, pure-Rust, ~150 KB compiled). POSIX-ERE
subset: anchors (`^`, `$`), character classes (`[abc]`, `[^abc]`),
groups (`(...)`), repetitions (`?*+{n,m}`), alternation (`|`),
shorthand classes (`\d`, `\w`, `\s` and their negations).

**`fixed = TRUE`** forces literal matching — `.` matches the literal
dot, not "any char". Matches R's `fixed=` semantics.

**Pattern compile failure → literal fallback.** If the regex fails to
parse, the function silently uses substring matching on the raw pattern
text. Means malformed regex doesn't error; it degrades.

**Building without regex:** `cargo build --no-default-features` skips
the `regex-lite` dep entirely. Falls back to literal-substring semantics.
Smaller binary, no regex syntax.

**Not supported (regex-lite limitation, intentional):**
- Lookaround (`(?=…)`, `(?!…)`) — R's default `extended=TRUE` mode
  doesn't either, so not a parity gap
- Backreferences (`\1`) in the pattern — R supports these in `perl=TRUE`
  mode; we don't
- Unicode category classes (`\p{Letter}`) — `regex-lite` is ASCII-fast
- PCRE-only features (recursive patterns, conditional groups, atomic
  groups)

For Unicode-heavy text or PCRE features, the full `regex` crate could
be a future feature flag, but for typical R idioms (`^foo$`,
`[A-Z][a-z]+`, `\d+\.\d+`) regex-lite is sufficient.

### `sprintf`

**Status:** Recognises `%d`, `%f`, `%s`, `%e`, `%%` only. No width or
precision specifiers (`%5d`, `%.2f`), no flags (`%-d`, `%+d`).

**Why:** v0.1.x simplification — covers the common case of inline value
substitution. The engine's pre-migration implementation had the same
limitation; it is now documented rather than hidden.

**Closure path:** Implement a real format-spec parser following C99
`printf` rules, or wrap `format!` via a runtime template engine.
No timeline yet.

## Data (`r2-data`)

### `merge(df1, df2)` — single-key inner join only

**Status (v0.1.0):** performs an inner join on a single shared column
(auto-detected, or named via `by=`). Non-key column-name collisions get
a `.y` suffix on the right side. NA propagation matches the engine
pre-migration behaviour.

**Not implemented:**
- Multi-column keys (`by = c("a", "b")`)
- Outer joins (`all.x = TRUE`, `all.y = TRUE`, full outer)
- Asymmetric key naming (`by.x = "id"`, `by.y = "user_id"`)
- Custom suffix control (`suffixes = c(".left", ".right")`)

**Closure path:** Add the missing parameters in a follow-up phase. Most
of the heavy lifting is already there — the matching loop is generic;
`all.x`/`all.y` just need an "unmatched rows go through with NA" pass.

## I/O (`r2-io`)

### CSV / TSV parser — RFC 4180 ✅ compliant

**Shipped this round:** `read.csv`/`read.table`/`read.delim` and
`write.csv`/`write.table` now use a proper RFC 4180 state-machine
parser. The four cases the previous line-split-and-trim approach
missed are all handled:

1. **Embedded separators in quoted fields:** `"a,b",c` is correctly
   parsed as 2 fields, not 3. Verified by regression test.
2. **Doubled quotes inside quoted fields:** `"He said ""hi"""` →
   `He said "hi"`. Both read and write sides escape correctly.
3. **Newlines inside quoted fields:** a quoted field can span multiple
   lines; the newline becomes part of the value.
4. **UTF-8 BOM stripping:** `\u{FEFF}` at file start is silently
   removed so the first column name isn't polluted.

**Write side:** column names always wrapped in `"..."` (matches R's
`quote=TRUE` default). Character fields wrapped + internal quotes
doubled. Numeric/integer fields emitted raw.

**Still not handled** (low-priority gaps):
- Mixed quote styles (single-quote-as-string-delim)
- Comment lines (`#` prefix skipping — R's `comment.char=` arg)
- Skip lines (`skip = N` argument)
- Encodings other than UTF-8 (latin-1, etc. — R's `fileEncoding=`)

Closure path for the remaining items: add the missing named args to
`bi_read_csv` and route through. Each is ~15 LoC.

## Stats — hypothesis tests (`r2_stats::htest`)

### `fisher.test()` — exact hypergeometric ✅ shipped (v0.1.0)

**Status:** **Fixed.** Now computes the two-sided p-value by exact
hypergeometric summation over all 2×2 outcomes at least as extreme as
observed. Matches R's `fisher.test` to within ~1e-4 across small-table
spot checks. The previous χ²-with-Yates approximation has been replaced.

### `t.test()` — Welch–Satterthwaite df ✅ shipped (v0.1.0)

**Bug fix:** Two-sample `t.test(x, y)` was reporting itself as
"Welch Two Sample t-test" while internally using the *pooled* Student
df (`nx + ny − 2`). The standard error was already the unequal-variance
form, but the df was the equal-variance form — inconsistent. Now uses
the proper Welch–Satterthwaite df formula
`(vx + vy)² / (vx²/(nx−1) + vy²/(ny−1))`, which matches R's
`t.test(x, y)$parameter` to ~1e-3.

### `t.test()` — formula syntax + paired test ✅ shipped (v0.1.0)

**New call shapes accepted:**
- `t.test(value ~ group)` — formula form. The `group` vector (Character,
  Factor, Logical, or Numeric) must have exactly 2 distinct levels.
  Splits `value` by group and runs a Welch two-sample test. Group
  labels (factor levels / unique values, in order of first appearance)
  appear in the printed output and as `$group1` / `$group2` fields.
- `t.test(x, y, paired=TRUE)` — paired test on `(x[i], y[i])`
  differences against `mu` (default 0). Standard one-sample-on-diffs
  with `df = n − 1`.

**Extension beyond R:** the paired output additionally reports the
**Pearson correlation** between the paired observations. Useful for
within-subject designs where the strength of pairing tells you how
much variance the pairing absorbed (high `r` ⇒ pairing was worth it).
Available as `$cor` on the returned object.

**Output labelling:** when called via formula, the printed `mean of …`
lines use the actual group labels from the factor/character levels
rather than the placeholder `x` / `y`.

**Within-subject auto-pairing — `id =` argument ✅ shipped:**
Repeated-measures pairing is now available via an explicit `id =`
argument:
```
t.test(value ~ group, id = subject, paired = TRUE)
```
For each subject id, the function finds the observation in each of the
two `group` levels and pairs them. Subjects without one observation in
each level are silently dropped (with a printed count). df = n_paired − 1.
Pearson r between the matched pairs is reported as `$cor`.

**Future work — `Error(subject/group)` formula syntax:** R uses this in
`aov()` for repeated-measures ANOVA but `t.test` in R doesn't accept it.
Adding it to our `t.test` would be a real engine change: the formula
parser currently evaluates `group + Error(subject/group)` as
arithmetic and fails because `Error` isn't a function. To support that
syntax we'd need to (1) detect `Error()` in formula RHS at the engine
NSE pre-processing layer, (2) extract the id symbol unevaluated,
(3) rewrite the call to inject an `id =` argument before t.test sees
it. Tracked as a parser-level enhancement; the `id =` syntax above
delivers the same statistical capability today.

**Pearson r in unpaired output:** previously added then removed —
for independent two-sample tests the as-input correlation is
sample-order coincidence, not a meaningful diagnostic, and reporting
it could mislead users. `$cor` is present only on the paired output.

### `t.test()` — t-CDF accuracy

**Status (v0.1.0):** The previous `df > 30 → normal-approx`
shortcut (~5e-3 absolute error at df=30) has been removed. `t_cdf` now
routes every df through the incomplete-beta identity. The integrator is
a 1000-panel trapezoidal rule — ~10× the previous resolution. Typical
absolute error ~1e-3 for moderate df, worse near boundaries.

**Tried and reverted:** A Lentz continued-fraction implementation
(Numerical Recipes §6.4) was attempted as part of the same polish pass.
It produced wrong values at the symmetry boundary when `b < 1` — a
known accuracy edge case for that recipe. Rather than ship a subtly
wrong implementation, we reverted to the verified rectangle path with
tighter resolution. The Lentz upgrade is on the roadmap as a focused
non-budget-constrained session.

**Closure path:** Replace the trapezoidal integrator with a verified
Lentz CF + symmetry-aware fallback for the `b < 1` corner. ~150 LoC
including the regression-test corpus needed to pin the corner cases.

## v0.1.0 Tier 0 polish round (historical record)

### Bugs fixed
- **`matrix(data, nrow, ncol)` positional args now honoured.** Previously
  only `nrow=` / `ncol=` keyword forms were read, so the R-idiomatic
  `matrix(rnorm(1e6), 1000, 1000)` silently produced a 1e6×1 column.
  Also added `byrow=` support.
- **`kmeans()` initialization spread + final size recompute.** Was
  initializing centroids with rows `0..k` (so close-together rows
  collapsed to a single cluster), and the convergence check broke out
  of the loop *before* sizes were ever computed if iteration 1 happened
  to match the initial all-zero `cluster` vector. Now uses evenly-spaced
  rows (`i*m/k`) for init and recomputes centroids + sizes
  unconditionally before checking convergence.
- **`rep()` works for character/integer/logical** (was numeric-only) and
  honours both `times=` and `each=` named args.
- **`factor()` accepts numeric/integer/logical** (was character-only).
  R-style: coerces to string first.

### Builtins added
- `binomial()`, `gaussian()`, `poisson()` — family constructors for
  `glm(family = binomial())`. Return tagged lists.
- `subset(df, mask)` — filter rows by logical mask.
- `transform(df, name = value)` — append/overwrite named columns.

### Subset/transform — NSE form shipped ✅

R's idiomatic `subset(df, x > 2)` and `transform(df, z = x + y)` are now
fully supported. The engine pre-processor (`Expr::Call` dispatch in
`r2-engine/src/lib.rs`) intercepts calls whose function name is `subset`
or `transform` with a data-frame as the first arg, evaluates the
remaining argument expressions in a child env that shadows globals with
the data-frame's columns, and passes the resulting values (logical mask
for subset, named columns for transform) to the underlying builtin.
Compound conditions (`subset(df, x > 1 & y < 50)`) and column-referencing
transforms (`transform(df, z = x + y)`, `transform(df, x = x * 2)`) both
work. Integration tests live in `crates/r2-engine/tests/nse_subset_transform.rs`.

**Closure-bug fix shipped in the same pass:** elementwise `&` and `|` on
logical vectors had no handler in `binary_op` and were silently falling
through the arithmetic arm to produce all-zero numeric output. Now
elementwise `&` / `|` (vector forms) and short-circuit `&&` / `||`
(scalar forms) both produce correct NA-aware logical results. Misleading
BinOp naming inherited from the lexer (single `&` → `BinOp::And`, double
`&&` → `BinOp::AndShort`) clarified with a comment block above the
handler.

## Memory layer (`r2-arrow`) — completion status

### F.6 storage migration ✅ shipped

`RVal::Integer` is now `Ints(Vec<Integer> + cached Arc<ColumnarI32>)`.
`RVal::Logical` is now `Logicals(Vec<Logical> + cached Arc<ColumnarBool>)`.
Same Deref/From pattern as `Reals`. First call to `.columnar()`
materialises the columnar form (O(n) one-time), subsequent calls are
`Arc::clone` (O(1)).

Memory footprint per million elements:
- Logical: `Vec<Option<bool>>` was 16 MB → `ColumnarBool` is 250 KB (~64× smaller)
- Integer: `Vec<Option<i32>>` was 8 MB → `ColumnarI32` is ~4.25 MB (~2× smaller)
- Numeric (F.3, already shipped): ~no change in footprint, but columnar
  bridge enables zero-copy SIMD-friendly access from JIT and kernels

### Still not implemented

| Item | Reason / closure |
|---|---|
| `ColumnarI64` | Mechanical copy of `ColumnarI32` with `i64`. Add when an actual i64 hot path materialises. |
| `ColumnarUtf8` | Variable-length strings need a separate offsets array + values byte buffer — its own design pass. R workloads rarely hit string-column performance limits today (R's `Vec<Option<Arc<str>>>` representation is adequate). |
| mmap write path | `MmapColumnar::open` is read-only. Writable mmap needs separate API. Out of scope until a real workload demands it. |
| Cross-platform endian conversion for mmap | Host byte order assumed. Cross-arch feeds would need explicit conversion. |
| Strided iteration in r2-kernel for non-contiguous matrix slices | **Shipped ✅** (Phase K.6). `reduce_strided(op, data, offset, stride, count)` walks every `stride`-th element of a flat slice without copying. Serial + Rayon backends; Rayon uses two-pass (parallel NA scan + parallel reduce of unwrapped values). All `ReduceOp` variants supported. Tests in `r2-kernel/src/lib.rs`. |
| Fused multiply-add (`MulAdd`) op in r2-kernel | **Shipped ✅** (Phase K.5). New `TernaryOp::MulAdd` + `TernaryBackend` trait with Serial/Rayon impls and Oracle-driven `ternary(op, a, b, c)` dispatcher. Uses `f64::mul_add` so on FMA-capable hardware the multiply+add is a single rounded operation. |

## Oracle layer — calibration intentionally bundled with hardware awareness

**Status:** the per-Op parallelism thresholds in `r2_oracle::dispatch` are
hand-tuned constants. A `r2-bench` crate that fits them to measured
crossover points was originally listed as Tier 4 polish.

**Plan change (recorded so it doesn't get relitigated):** that calibration
work has been **removed from Tier 4 and folded into the Phase G
hardware-awareness phase**. Reasoning:

1. **Cores.** Bench numbers measured on an N-core dev laptop don't transfer
   to a 64-core server (parallel crossover happens at much smaller N) or
   a 2-core VM (crossover at much larger N). A single static calibrated
   table is wrong everywhere except the calibration machine.
2. **ISA / SIMD width.** `MulAdd` and the JIT vector paths get 2× swings
   depending on whether FMA3 / AVX2 / AVX-512 / SVE2 is available.
3. **Cache hierarchy.** Matmul block sizes and strided-reduce crossovers
   depend on L1 / L2 / L3 sizes, which vary by 5× across realistic targets.

So calibration without hardware introspection is *less* portable than
the current conservative hand-tuned constants — and any work we do
before the hardware-awareness layer would have to be redone after.

**Closure path (Phase G, deferred):** add an `r2_oracle::hw` module that
detects cores, CPU features (`std::is_x86_feature_detected!` for x86,
cfg-gated ARM equivalents), and cache sizes. Make the threshold table
parametric in `Hw`: closed-form rules like
`parallel_threshold(op) = base / hw.cores` rather than flat constants.
Once that lands, *then* per-machine calibration becomes additive —
benchmarks refine the closed-form residuals rather than fitting from
scratch on the wrong basis.

**Until then:** the current thresholds are intentionally conservative
(bias toward Serial when N is borderline) so they're never wildly wrong
on any deployment. Worst case is "could be faster on a big box"; never
"slower than Serial on a small box."

## Other domains

(no other intentional limitations recorded yet — additions go here
as we encounter them)
